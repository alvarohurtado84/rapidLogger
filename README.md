# rapidLogger

rapidLogger is trying to bring the Bullet Journal system (http://bulletjournal.com/) to the web.

### How?

I will use Django + Django Rest Framework in the backend side. I will use AngujarJS in frontend.

### Why?

Because I like Bullet Journal.
Because I want to learn how to build APIs.
Because I want to learn how to build Single Page Applications.
